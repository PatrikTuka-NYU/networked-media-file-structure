    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>When I first read the assignment description the first thing that came to mind was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/">Black Mirror - Bandersnatch</a>. It is one the first Netflix Interactive movies, reimaging the usual <b>choose-your-own-adventure books</b> in a new medium. It is a very interesting experience. You get to go through different paths, and although usual viewtime is an hour and half, I definitely spent way more time figuring out, and drawing a map of decision and paths, trying to figure it out as a riddle. I did find a map of it in the end, but I would definitely recommend viewing if you haven't done so, so please have a quick glance but don't read through the whole thing to avoid spoilers.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>

    <p>After creating an inital <a href="https://pin.it/3PtLdbkvr">moodboard</a>, which compiled visual aethetics, underlying psychological theory, and storylines, I jumped right into ChatGPT to collectively figure out a storyline. I'm going to be honest it was mostly Chat who came up with the storyline and flow of it, but it wasn't perfect the first time by no means, so a couple of revisions was required.</p>
    <p>After I had the story, I started skeching out the possible paths, and connection between them, assigning the text snippets to different html files numberred 01 - 08.</p>
    <p>Then a bit of Figma and some very minimal means of CSS styling, and we were done!</p>

    <h3>Possible Means of Improvement</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Due to time limitations I didn't get to explore many aspects of this project, but I would love to work on making the story more coherent and more ellaborate, having more recurring loops, being able to get lost in the story to convey the message better across. Additionally, I would also like to improve the look and feel of it, maybe have a <b>type-out effect</b> of the texts and include <b>chromating abberation</b> just to give a couple of examples. Lastly I would still like to be able to change out the document title (indicating changing of time) when you revisit a page.</p>
