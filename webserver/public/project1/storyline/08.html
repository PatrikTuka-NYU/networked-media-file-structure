      Back in your dorm, you sit at your desk, staring at your laptop screen.
      The day has felt off in so many ways, as if you were in autopilot monde, as if your choices weren’t your own. You reflect on each
      moment and can’t shake the feeling that you’ve been here before, doing
      exactly the same things. The choices you thought were yours start to blur,
      and you begin to wonder: Were they ever really your own?
    </p>

    <p>
      Your screen flickers, and a new message pops up: “Meeting at 3:00 PM.
      Don’t be late.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock on your laptop shows the same time you started the day.
      Everything reset...
